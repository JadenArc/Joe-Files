# Joe's Server Files
In this (special) repo, you'll find continuing updates from the SRB2 server called `Joe's Bizarre Server`.

## Things to note
This is a repo, so you'll find the servers PK3s splitted on `src`, with their respective folders.
Please note that the `Maps` file ain't included, as that requires manual editing.

If you want to clone and play with this, you'll need some zip program like `7Zip`, `WinRAR`, etc; and zip either `main` or `utilities`.
